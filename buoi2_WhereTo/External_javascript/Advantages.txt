*External JavaScript Advantages
Placing scripts in external files has some advantages:

It separates HTML and code
It makes HTML and JavaScript easier to read and maintain
Cached JavaScript files can speed up page loads

*External References
An external script can be referenced in 3 different ways:

With a full URL (a full web address) -> <script src="https://www.w3schools.com/js/myScript.js"></script>
With a file path (like /js/) -> <script src="/js/myScript.js"></script>
Without any  -> <script src="myScript.js"></script>
